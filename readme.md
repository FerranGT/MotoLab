#MOTOLAB PROJECT

This project is created as a Front-End project in the BootCamp SkylabCoders in 2016 by Cristina, Daniel and Ferran. Although we use Firebase we can use a database, an storage and a hosting, turning this project as a Full-Stack Project.

##The Goal 

This project is create as a motorbykes repair site. Where the owner of the site can upload the bykes that he wants to sell by internet, so any user can check all the bikes existing in the site but only the administrator can create and delete new bike items.

## Technolgies used

We work with **html-5**, **CSS3** and **Bootstrap** to create the site. With **Angular** we make the double binding and we can create the major part of the site dinamically, also we use the Api **vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/** to get all the brands and models of bikes existing.

The big point of this project is we create the triple binding with **Firebase**. So we can use a database, a storage and hosting, on real time.
