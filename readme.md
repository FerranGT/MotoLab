#MOTOLAB PROJECT

This project is created as a Front-End project in the BootCamp SkylabCoders in 2016 by Cristina, Daniel and Ferran. Although we use Firebase we can use a database, an storage and a hosting, turning this project as a Full-Stack Project.

##The Goal 

This project is created for motorbikes repair shops. The owner of the site can upload the bikes that he wants to sell online, so any user can check the existing bikes in the site and get updated information about them. Only the administrator can create and delete the items.

## Technologies used

We worked with **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **Bootstrap** to create the site. With **AngularJS** we made the double binding so we can create the major part of the site dinamically, also we uses the Api **vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/** to get all the brands and models of existing bikes.

The most relevant aspect of this project is we created the triple binding with Google's **Firebase**. So we can use a database, a storage and hosting, that updates changes for each in real time.
